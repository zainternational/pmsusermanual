# Build and validate the Hotelium PMS user manual.
# - Runs on push/PR to main (and optionally other branches).
# - Fails on broken links (Docusaurus onBrokenLinks: 'throw').
# - Use this workflow when pmsusermanual is the repository root.
#   If pmsusermanual lives in a parent repo (e.g. ZAPMS), add a workflow there
#   that runs "npm ci && npm run build" from the pmsusermanual directory.
