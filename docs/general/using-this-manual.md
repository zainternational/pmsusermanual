# Using This Manual

Short guide to **finding your way** and **using** the Hotelium PMS manual.

## Search

Use the **search** bar in the top-right of the navbar (or **Ctrl+K** / **Cmd+K**) to search all docs. Type terms like “folio”, “night audit”, “cash register”, “reservation”, or “check-in” to jump to the right page.

## Breadcrumbs and sidebar

- **Breadcrumbs** (above the doc) show where you are, e.g. **Docs > Operations > Reservations**.
- The **sidebar** lists all sections. Collapse or expand categories as needed. On some setups you can hide the sidebar for more reading space.

## Last updated

When the manual is built from a git repository, each doc page shows **“Last updated”** at the bottom with the date of the last edit. Use it as a rough guide to how recent the content is.

## Back to top

On long pages, a **Back to top** button (↑) appears when you scroll down. Click it to scroll to the top of the page.

## Print and PDF

- **Print** — Use your browser’s **Print** (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P). The manual uses print styles so the main content prints without the navbar and sidebar.
- **Save as PDF** — In the Print dialog, choose **Save as PDF** (or similar) as the destination.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| **Search** (open search) | **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) · **Cmd+K** (Mac) |
| **Print** | **Ctrl+P** (Windows/Linux) · **Cmd+P** (Mac) |
| **Back to top** | Click the **↑** button when it appears after scrolling (no keyboard shortcut) |

## Accessibility and devices

The manual is **readable on phones and tablets** — the layout adapts to small screens so you can look up topics on the go. We follow common web accessibility practices (semantic structure, keyboard navigation, contrast) and continue to improve where we can.
