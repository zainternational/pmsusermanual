# Profile and Security

This page covers **profile details** (viewing and editing your user profile) and **changing your password**.

## Profile Details

Your user profile stores your display name, job title, contact details, and similar information. Access it from the **profile** or **account** area in the top bar (e.g. your name or avatar → Profile / Profile details).

From the profile details screen you can:

- View your **username**, **email**, **job title**, and other stored fields
- Edit allowed fields (depending on configuration)
- Go to **Change password** if the option is shown

## Change Password

You can change your password from **Profile → Change password** (or the link in the profile/account menu). The change-password screen is also available at **Change Password** in the app when your administrator has exposed it.

### Steps

1. Open **Change password** (from your profile/account menu or direct link).
2. Enter your **current password**.
3. Enter your **new password**. It must meet the following rules:
   - At least **6 characters**
   - At least **one uppercase letter**
   - At least **one number**
   - At least **one special character** (e.g. `! @ # $ %`)
4. Enter the **new password again** in the confirmation field.
5. Click **Change password** (or **Submit**).

If the change succeeds, you are signed out and redirected to the **login** page. Log in again using your **new password**.

:::tip **Forgot current password?**  
You cannot change your password without the current one. If you have forgotten it, contact your administrator or IT support to reset your password.

### After Changing Password

- You must use the **new password** for all future logins.
- Other sessions may be invalidated; you may need to log in again on other devices or tabs.
