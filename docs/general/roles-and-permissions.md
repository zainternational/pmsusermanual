# Roles and Permissions

What you see and can do in the PMS depends on your **user permissions**. Permissions are assigned by your administrator through **user groups** or direct user rights. This page summarises **which menu areas typically require which access**.

## Sidebar Menu and Access

If you **do not see** a menu item, your user probably does not have the permission needed for that part of the system.

| Menu or section | What you need (typical) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Dashboard** | No special permission; usually visible to all logged-in users. |
| **Profile** (Individual / Company / Travel Agent) | Permission to view at least one profile type (individual, company, or travel agent). |
| **Reservation** | Permission to view, add, or edit reservations. |
| **Front Desk** (Room plan, In-house, Checked-out) | Permission to view reservations and/or to check in / check out, and often account-receivable access. |
| **Cashiering** (Transaction, Cashier shift, Quick checkout) | Cashier permission. You also must log in to a **cash register** before using cashier screens. |
| **Housekeeping** | Permission to view room status, out-of-order, maintenance, tasks, and/or lost & found. |
| **Night Audit** | Night audit permission. |
| **Report** | Permission to view reports. |
| **Operations → General →** [**User Activity Logs**](/docs/operations/general/user-activity-logs) | Permission to view user activity logs. |
| **System Settings** | At least one permission in setup (e.g. rooms, rates, reservation setup, profiles, cashiering, housekeeping, account receivables). The full System Settings menu shows all config areas your account can access. |

## Permission Types

Permissions are usually grouped by **area**:

- **Profile management** — Individual, company, travel agent (view / add / edit / delete).
- **Reservation management** — Reservations (view / add / edit / delete), check-in, check-out, cancel, waitlist.
- **Front desk / AR** — Account receivable, in-house, checked-out, room plan.
- **Cashier** — View cashier, use transaction / shift / quick checkout.
- **Housekeeping** — Room status, out-of-order, maintenance, tasks, lost & found, sections, attendants, etc.
- **Night audit** — Run night audit, view runs and reports.
- **Reports** — View (and sometimes generate or export) reports.
- **User activity log** — View (and sometimes export) activity logs.
- **Setup / configuration** — Each setup area (e.g. rooms, rates, transaction codes, users) has its own view / add / edit / delete permissions.

Your administrator assigns these through **user groups** or per-user settings in **System Settings → Users / User groups**.

## What to Do If You Need Access

- **Missing menu or button** — Ask your administrator to grant the right permissions or add you to a user group that has them.
- **“Access denied” or similar** — You tried an action your account is not allowed to do; request the specific permission (e.g. “edit reservations”, “run night audit”) from your admin.

Exact permission names and behaviour can vary by deployment; your administrator has the definitive list for your property.
