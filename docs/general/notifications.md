# Notifications

The PMS shows **notifications** in the top bar via a **bell icon**. Use them to stay informed about housekeeping, reservations, and billing without leaving your current screen.

## Where to Find Notifications

- Look for the **bell icon** in the **header** or **top bar** (usually top-right).
- A **badge** or **number** on the bell shows how many **unread** notifications you have.

## What Notifications Show

Notifications can include:

- **Housekeeping** — Lost & found, room status changes, maintenance, tasks, out-of-order
- **Reservations** — New or updated reservations, or other reservation-related alerts
- **Billing** — Payments, transactions, or billing alerts

The exact types depend on how your property has configured the system.

## Using Notifications

- **Open the list** — Click the bell to see recent notifications.
- **Read one** — Click a notification. It is marked as **read** and you are taken to the relevant screen when the system can determine it (e.g. a specific housekeeping tab, reservations, or billing).
- **Unread count** — The number on the bell updates as you read items. The list is refreshed automatically (e.g. every few seconds) so new notifications appear without reloading the page.

## Where You Are Taken

When you click a notification, the app tries to open the most relevant screen:

| If the notification is about… | You are typically taken to… |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Lost & found                  | Housekeeping → Lost & found tab |
| Room status                  | Housekeeping → Room status tab  |
| Maintenance                  | Housekeeping → Maintenance tab  |
| Housekeeping tasks           | Housekeeping → Tasks tab         |
| Out of order                 | Housekeeping → Out of order tab |
| Housekeeping (general)       | Housekeeping management          |
| Reservations                 | Reservation list                 |
| Billing / payment / transaction | Billing / Cashiering         |

If the message does not match any of these, the notification may only be marked as read and no navigation occurs.

## Tips

- Check the bell regularly so you don’t miss housekeeping or billing alerts.
- Clearing the list does not delete the underlying data; it only marks items as read in your notification list.
