# Profile Setup

Profile setup includes reference data used in individual, company, and travel agent profiles: preferences, VIP levels, loyalty tiers, titles, languages, nationalities, regions, countries, territories, states, districts, cities, postal codes, and inactive reason.

In the PMS, these screens are under **Configuration → Profile**. What you see depends on **user permissions**.

## Typical workflow

2. Define **Titles**, **Languages**, **Nationalities**.
3. Define **VIP Levels**, **Preferences**, **Loyalty Tiers** if used.
4. Define **Inactive Reason** if needed for profiles or rates.

From the sidebar, go to **Configuration** → **Profile**, then open the sub-item you need.
