# Quick Start

Follow these steps **in order** to see the main flow of the PMS: **login → dashboard → one reservation → one check-in → one folio**. Use this path when you are new to the system or training staff.

:::tip **More detail**  
Each step links to the full doc. For login, navigation, and “By role”, see [Introduction](/docs/intro). For end-to-end flows, see [Workflows](/docs/operations/workflows).
:::

## 1. Log in

1. Open the PMS in your browser.
2. Enter your **username** and **password**.
3. Click **Login**. You are taken to the **Dashboard**.

See [Introduction → Logging in](/docs/intro#logging-in) for details and screenshots.

## 2. Open the Dashboard

After login you land on the **Dashboard**. From here you can:

- See occupancy, revenue, and housekeeping summary
- Use quick links into reservations, room plan, and other modules

Spend a moment looking at the widgets and quick actions. See [Dashboard](/docs/operations/dashboard) for full detail.

## 3. Create or find one reservation

1. Go to **Reservation** in the sidebar.
2. Either **create a new reservation** (guest, dates, room type/room, rate) or **find an existing reservation** for today’s arrival.
3. Make sure it is **Confirmed** (or equivalent) and has a **room** (or room type) and **rate**.

See [Reservations](/docs/operations/reservations/overview) and [Reservation list](/docs/operations/reservations/list) for creating and editing reservations.

## 4. Do one check-in

1. Ensure the **room** is ready: in **Housekeeping**, the room should be **Vacant Clean** (or Ready). Change status if needed.
2. Open the reservation (from **Reservation** or **Front Desk → Room plan** or **In-House**).
3. Use **Check in**. The reservation becomes **In-house** (or **Checked in**).
4. The guest is now in-house; charges can post to their **folio**.

See [Front Desk](/docs/operations/front-desk/overview), [Room plan](/docs/operations/front-desk/room-plan), and [Workflows → Check-in](/docs/operations/workflows#check-in-flow) for the full check-in flow.

## 5. Open the folio and post once

1. For **Cashiering**, log in to a **cash register** first if prompted (**Cash Register Login**).
2. Go to **Cashiering → Transaction**.
3. **Select the reservation** you just checked in. Its **guest folio** opens.
4. Optionally **add a charge** (e.g. room, tax) or **post a payment** (e.g. deposit). Save.
5. You have now used: **login → dashboard → reservation → check-in → folio** in one short path.

See [Cashiering](/docs/operations/cashiering/overview) and [Transaction (Guest Folio)](/docs/operations/cashiering/transaction) for daily cashier and folio work.
