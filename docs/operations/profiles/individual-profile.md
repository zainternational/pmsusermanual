# Individual Profile

**Individual Profile** stores data for persons used as guests or contacts in reservations.

## Accessing Individual Profiles

From the sidebar: **Profile → Individual Profile**.

## Individual Profile List

The list shows individuals with typical columns:

- Name
- Title
- Contact (phone, email)
- VIP level (if used)
- Nationality, country
- Last stay or last activity (if available)

Use **search** and **filters** (e.g. name, VIP, nationality) to find profiles.

## Creating an Individual Profile

1. Click **Add** or **New Individual Profile**.
2. Fill in at least the required fields, for example:
   - **Name**
   - **Title** (from setup)
   - **Contact** — Phone, email
   - **Address** — Country, city, state, postal code (from setup where applicable)
   - **Nationality** (from setup)
   - **VIP level** (from setup)
   - **ID / NRC** if used
   - **Preferences**, **loyalty tier**, **language** if available
3. Save. The profile can then be used in reservations.

## Editing an Individual Profile

1. Open the profile from the list (click row or name).
2. Change any allowed fields.
3. Save. Changes apply to future reservations; existing reservations may keep the data they had at creation, depending on configuration.

## Using in Reservations

When creating or editing a reservation:

- **Guest** — Select an individual profile as the main guest.
- **Contact** — Optionally link another individual as contact or secondary guest.

Profiles are linked to the reservation; updates to the profile do not always change past reservations.

## Configuration

Titles, countries, states, cities, nationalities, VIP levels, languages, preferences, and loyalty tiers are defined under **Configuration → Profile** (or equivalent). Create those codes first so individual profiles use consistent values.
