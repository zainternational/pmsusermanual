# Company Profile

**Company Profile** stores data for companies used as guests, payers, or group organisers in reservations.

## Accessing Company Profiles

From the sidebar: **Profile → Company Profile**.

## Company Profile List

The list shows companies with typical columns:

- Company name
- Code (if used)
- Contact (phone, email)
- Address
- Last stay or last activity (if available)

Use **search** and **filters** (e.g. name, code) to find profiles.

## Creating a Company Profile

1. Click **Add** or **New Company Profile**.
2. Fill in at least the required fields, for example:
   - **Company name**
   - **Code** (if your property uses it)
   - **Contact** — Phone, email, contact person
   - **Address** — Country, city, state, postal code (from setup where applicable)
   - **Tax ID** or **registration number** if used
   - **Payment terms** or **credit limit** if used for billing
3. Save. The profile can then be used in reservations and billing.

## Editing a Company Profile

1. Open the profile from the list (click row or name).
2. Change any allowed fields.
3. Save. Changes apply to future reservations and billing; existing data may not change automatically.

## Using in Reservations and Billing

When creating or editing a reservation:

- **Guest** — Use the company as the main guest (e.g. corporate stay).
- **Payer** — Route all or part of the bill to the company (billing/routing).
- **Group** — Use the company as the group organiser or master bill payer.

In **Cashiering**, use **routing** or **split folio** to send charges to the company profile.

## Configuration

Countries, states, cities, and other address/location codes are defined under **Configuration → Profile**. Set those up first so company profiles use consistent values.
