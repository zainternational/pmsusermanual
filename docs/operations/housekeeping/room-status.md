# Room Status

The **Room Status** tab shows current status of all rooms. Use it to see which rooms are ready, need cleaning, or are out of order.

## Typical statuses (names may vary)

- **Vacant Clean** — Ready to sell
- **Vacant Dirty** — Needs cleaning
- **Occupied Clean** — Guest in room, cleaned
- **Occupied Dirty** — Guest in room, needs cleaning
- **Pick-up** — Service requested or pick-up needed
- **Inspected** — Supervised check done
- **Out of Order** — Not sellable (e.g. repair)
- **Out of Service** — Withdrawn from inventory

## Updating Room Status

1. Locate the room in the list or plan.
2. Change its status (e.g. from Vacant Dirty to Vacant Clean after cleaning).
3. Save. The dashboard and front desk room plan can reflect this.
