# Tasks

The **Tasks** tab is used to create housekeeping tasks, assign them to attendants or sections, and mark them done or in progress.

## Typical uses

- Create **housekeeping tasks** (e.g. clean room, deep clean, VIP setup)
- **Assign** tasks to attendants or sections
- Mark tasks **done** or **in progress**

Tasks are often linked to rooms and to **housekeeping setup tasks** defined in Configuration → HouseKeeping & Maintenance → **HK Task**.
