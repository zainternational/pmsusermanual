# Lost & Found

In **Lost & Found** you can register found items, link to a lost & found reason if configured, search by guest/room/date/item, and record when the item is returned or disposed of.

## Registering a found item

- **Room**, **date**, **description**, **location** (from setup)
- **Lost & found reason** if configured

Notifications may alert staff when new lost & found entries are added.
