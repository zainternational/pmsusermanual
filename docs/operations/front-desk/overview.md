# Front Desk Overview

The **Front Desk** area covers room plan, in-house guests, and checked-out guests. Use it for daily front-office tasks, room assignment, and quick access to **folio** and checkout.

In the app, **Front Desk** is a menu with three sub-screens:

| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| [Room Plan](/docs/operations/front-desk/room-plan) | View rooms and occupancy by date; assign rooms, check in, start new reservations. |
| [In-House](/docs/operations/front-desk/in-house) | List of guests currently checked in; open reservation or folio, check out, change room. |
| [Checked-Out](/docs/operations/front-desk/checked-out) | List of departed guests; review check-outs, reopen folio if allowed. |

## Access

From the sidebar, open **Front Desk**, then choose **Room Plan**, **In-House**, or **Checked-Out**. What you see depends on **user permissions**.

## Common FAQs

**Why don't I see the Room Plan or In-House list?**  
Your user may not have front-desk or reservation permission. Ask your administrator to grant access to Front Desk (room plan, in-house, checked-out).

**What is the difference between In-House and Checked-Out?**  
**In-House** shows guests currently staying (checked in, not yet departed). **Checked-Out** shows guests who have already departed, usually for a selected date or range.

For more FAQs and troubleshooting, see [Room Plan](/docs/operations/front-desk/room-plan#troubleshooting), [In-House](/docs/operations/front-desk/in-house), or [Checked-Out](/docs/operations/front-desk/checked-out). For general issues, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/general/troubleshooting).
