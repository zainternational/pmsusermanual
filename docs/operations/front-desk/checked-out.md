# Checked-Out

The **Checked-Out** list shows guests who have already departed, usually for a selected date or range. Use it to review departed guests, reopen a folio if needed (within policy), and verify check-outs and billing.

## Access

From the sidebar: **Front Desk** → **Checked-Out**.

## Common Actions

- Review departed guests
- Reopen a folio if needed (within policy)
- Verify check-outs and billing

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Cannot reopen a checked-out folio** | Policy or permission may restrict reopening after checkout. | Follow your property's policy; if allowed, use the reopen or edit action from Checked-Out. Contact your administrator if the option is missing. |

For general issues, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/general/troubleshooting).
