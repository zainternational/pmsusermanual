# Room Plan

The **Room Plan** shows rooms and their status over a chosen date range. Use it to see availability and quickly assign or change rooms.

## Access

From the sidebar: **Front Desk** → **Room Plan**.

## What You See

- Rooms grouped by floor, type, or layout
- For each room: status (e.g. available, occupied, out of order, maintenance), guest name, arrival/departure, housekeeping status
- Filters by date, room type, status, floor, etc.

## Common Actions

- **Select a room** — Click a room to see reservation details or actions.
- **New reservation** — Start a reservation for that room/date (opens reservation form).
- **Check in** — If the reservation is due and the room is ready, check the guest in from the room plan or reservation detail.
- **Check out** — Complete checkout from the room or from the reservation.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Room plan shows wrong date** | The selected date or business date is not the one you expect. | Change the date filter on the room plan. If your property uses a system (business) date, ensure night audit has been run up to the date you need. |
| **Cannot check in from room plan** | Reservation not due or not in a check-in-allowed status; room not ready. | Ensure arrival is today (or within policy), status is confirmed, and in Housekeeping the room is Vacant Clean / Ready. |
