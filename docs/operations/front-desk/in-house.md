# In-House

The **In-House** list shows all guests currently checked in. Use it to find a guest, open their reservation or folio, and perform check-out, room change, or add services.

## Access

From the sidebar: **Front Desk** → **In-House**.

## What You See

Typical information:

- Guest name
- Room number
- Arrival and planned departure
- Folio/balance (or link to billing)

## Common Actions

- Find a guest quickly
- Open their reservation or folio
- Perform check-out, room change, or add services

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **In-House list is empty but I have guests** | Filter (date, property) or permission may be hiding results. | Check date range and property filter. Confirm your user has permission to view in-house reservations. |
