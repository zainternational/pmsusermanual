# Departures

The **Departures** view (or filter) shows guests departing on a selected date. Use it to see who is due to check out and prepare folios and checkout.

## Access

From the sidebar: **Reservation**, then choose **Departures** or set the **departure date** filter. The exact label may be “Departures”, “Departures Today”, or a date filter depending on the app.

## What You See

Reservations with **departure date** on the selected date, typically with:

- Guest name
- Room number
- Arrival and departure dates
- Status (e.g. checked in, checked out)
- Folio/balance (or link to billing)

Use this view to settle folios, perform check-out, and confirm rooms for housekeeping.
