# Arrivals

The **Arrivals** view (or filter) shows guests arriving on a selected date. Use it to see who is due to check in and prepare rooms and check-in.

## Access

From the sidebar: **Reservation**, then choose **Arrivals** or set the **arrival date** filter. The exact label may be “Arrivals”, “Arrivals Today”, or a date filter depending on the app.

## What You See

Reservations with **arrival date** on the selected date, typically with:

- Guest name
- Room type / room number
- Arrival and departure dates
- Status (e.g. confirmed, checked in)
- Rate / amount

Use this view to confirm room readiness, assign rooms, and perform check-in.
