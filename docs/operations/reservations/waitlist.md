# Waitlist

The **Waitlist** is used when no suitable room or rate is available. Store the request and convert it to a full reservation when space opens.

## Access

From the sidebar: **Reservation**, then the **Waitlist** tab or link (if your property uses waitlist).

## What You Do

- **Add** a waitlist request — Requested dates, room type, guest, and contact details.
- **Store** requested dates, room type, guest, and contact details.
- When space opens, **convert** the waitlist entry into a full reservation.

Use the waitlist to avoid losing demand when the house is full or rates are closed.
