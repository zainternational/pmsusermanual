# All Reservations (List)

The **reservation list** (or “All Reservations”) shows all bookings. Use it to search, filter, create, edit, and manage reservations.

## Access

From the sidebar: **Reservation** (main list). You may also reach it from **Dashboard** → **View reservations** or similar.

## What You See

Typical columns:

- Confirmation/reference
- Guest name
- Room type / room number
- Arrival and departure dates
- Status (e.g. reserved, confirmed, checked-in, checked-out, cancelled)
- Nights
- Rate / amount

Use **filters** and **search** (by name, confirmation, dates, etc.) to find specific reservations.

## Creating a New Reservation

1. Click **New Reservation** (or use the quick action from the Dashboard).
2. Fill in the main details:
   - **Guest** — Select or create an individual, company, or travel agent profile.
   - **Dates** — Arrival and departure.
   - **Room type** — Desired room type; the system may suggest or assign a specific room.
   - **Rate** — Rate code, rate amount, or package.
   - **Adults / Children** — Occupancy.
   - **Special requests**, **market**, **source**, **reservation type**, etc., if available.
3. Save. A confirmation number is generated.

You can also start from **Front Desk → Room Plan** by selecting a room and choosing “New reservation” for that room/date.

## Editing a Reservation

1. Open the reservation from the list (click the row or confirmation number).
2. Change any allowed fields (dates, room, rate, guest, comments, etc.).
3. Save. Billing and room assignment may update automatically depending on configuration.

## Reservation Details View

From the reservation detail screen you can:

- View and edit **guest**, **stay**, **room**, and **rate** information
- See **billing/folio** and add charges or payments (or go to Cashiering)
- Add **comments** or **internal notes**
- View **alerts** and **messages**
- Manage **routing** (e.g. split billing or route to different profiles)
