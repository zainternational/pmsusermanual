# Cancellations

The **Cancellations** view lists cancelled reservations. When you cancel a reservation, you often must choose a **cancellation reason** (from configuration). Cancellation may trigger policies (e.g. fees, release of inventory) depending on setup.

## Access

From the sidebar: **Reservation**, then the **Cancellations** tab or link (if your property uses it).

## What You See

- List and **filter** cancelled reservations
- Cancellation date, reason, and related details (depending on the app)

When **cancelling** a reservation (from the reservation detail or list), select a **cancellation reason** from the list. Add or manage reasons in **Configuration → Reservation** → **Cancellation Reason**.
