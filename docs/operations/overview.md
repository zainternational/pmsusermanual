# Operations Overview

**Operations** covers the day-to-day use of the PMS: reservations, front desk, **cashiering** (folio, **cash register**), housekeeping, **night audit**, and **reports**. Use this section to find the right screen and workflow for each task.

:::tip **Having a problem?**  
Each module has its own **Common FAQs** and **Troubleshooting** sections. See the main [Troubleshooting](/docs/general/troubleshooting) page — it links to module-specific help for [Reservations](/docs/operations/reservations/overview#troubleshooting), [Front Desk](/docs/operations/front-desk/overview), [Cashiering](/docs/operations/cashiering/overview), [Housekeeping](/docs/operations/housekeeping/overview), [Night Audit](/docs/operations/night-audit#troubleshooting), [Dashboard](/docs/operations/dashboard#troubleshooting), [Configuration](/docs/configuration/overview#troubleshooting), and [Profiles](/docs/operations/profiles/overview#troubleshooting).
:::

**Structure:** **Reservations** has an overview and sub-views (All Reservations, Arrivals, Departures, Waitlist, Cancellations). **Profiles** has an overview and one doc per profile type. **Front Desk**, **Cashiering**, **Housekeeping**, and **Reports** each have an overview and one doc per sub-screen (e.g. Front Desk → Room Plan, In-House, Checked-Out). **Night Audit** is a single doc; **Workflows** covers end-to-end flows.
