# Quick Checkout

**Quick Checkout** speeds up departure by selecting one or more reservations, applying standard charges to the **folio** if not already posted, taking final payment at the **cash register**, and marking them checked out.

## Access

From the sidebar: **Cashiering** → **Quick Checkout**. You must complete **Cash Register Login** first if prompted.

## Typical Steps

- Select one or more reservations (e.g. by room or name)
- Apply standard charges (e.g. room, tax) if not already posted
- Take final payment and mark the reservation(s) as checked out

Exact steps depend on your property's setup.
