## Getting Started

:::tip **First day? Do these steps in order.**  
[**Quick start**](/docs/quickstart) walks through: **login → dashboard → one reservation → one check-in → one folio**. Follow it step by step, then use the links below for detail.
:::

### Logging In

1. Open the PMS application in your browser.
2. Enter your **username** (at least 3 characters).
3. Enter your **password** (at least 6 characters).
4. Click **Login**. If credentials are valid, you are redirected to the **Dashboard**.

If you are not logged in and open the app, you are redirected to the login page. After login, you are sent to the Dashboard.

:::info **Suggested screenshot**

### Main Navigation

The main sidebar shows:

- **Dashboard** — Home and overview
- **Profile** — Individual Profile, Company Profile, Travel Agent Profile
- **Reservation** — Reservations (includes waitlist and cancellation views)
- **Front Desk** — Room Plan, In-House, Checked-Out
- **Cashiering** — Transaction, Cashier Shift, Quick Checkout

- **Night Audit** — Night audit runs and summaries
- **Report** — Reservation, Frontdesk, Billing, Housekeeping, Night Audit
- **Operations → General** — User Activity Logs (if permitted)
- **System Settings** — All configuration screens

Visibility of menus depends on your **user permissions**. If you do not see a section, your account may not have access.

:::tip **Print or save as PDF**  
Use your browser’s **Print** (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P) to print a page or **Save as PDF**. The manual uses print-friendly styles so the main content prints without the navbar and sidebar.
:::

### Hotel / Cash Register

- Use the **hotel switcher** (if multi-property) to change the active property.
- For **Cashiering**, you must log in to a **cash register** first. Use **Cash Register Login** (e.g. from Cashiering → Transaction) and then continue to the requested cashier screen.
